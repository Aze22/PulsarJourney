Chapter_0_Content,"Hello, and welcome to this companion app to the narrative installation <b>The Pulsar's Jouney</b>!

I will quickly introduce the project before I'll let you wander from one painting to the next. In 2017 it will be <b>the 50th anniversary</b> of the discovery of the first pulsar by <b>Jocelyn Bell</b>.

This object has long fascinated me and when I met with the people at PARI we talked about their collection and their desire to attract people beyond science fans. Our intention is to communicate widely and share our passion for the stars.

This exhibition narrates <b>the story of a pulsar</b>, of its discovery, of its study.
We'll brush on various topics of astronomy but we'll also look at how scientists and artists look at the strange and the foreign, how they approach what is different and new.

Each chapter is composed of <b>a unique painting</b>, a <b>paragraph that will be read</b> to you and <b>LED lighting</b> that is controlled by <b>Arduino</b> cards placed at the back of the paintings. 

You are <b>welcome to take photographs and share</b> them with your friends and on social media, but if you do please credit the artist for this work.

The project is partly self funded, supported by PARI and the artists Patrons:
<b>https://www.patreon.com/FromTheEdge</b>

Your support will be welcome so that the exhibition can then travel to Europe, you can <b>visit the artist page</b> to support her, visit the PARI website to help them host future art exhibitions.
You can also buy postcards and catalogues on the site.

We <b>thank you</b> for your visit and we wish you a very enjoyable experience!"
